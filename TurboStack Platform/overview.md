# Overview
 
Welcome to the TurboStack Platform, your go-to place for all server configurations. Follow this guide to set up your application smoothly and get it running in no time.
 
## Locating your managed servers
 
When going to the [TurboStack Platform](https://my.turbostack.app/ "TurboStack Platform"), log in with your credentials for the [Customer Center](https://portal.hosted-power.com/ "Customer Center").
 
If you don't have credentials for the [Customer Center](https://portal.hosted-power.com/ "Customer Center") yet, you first have to create a Primary account. More info [here](../quickstart.md "here").

# Hosts overview

A few main functions are available for each server:

![General functions](img/tsa_server_tab1.png)

1. Switch between the GUI layout and the (advanced) YAML layout
2. Revisions: shows all historic configuration changes made to the server
3. Fetch the credentials and IPs of the server's users and databases
4. Save any changes made to the configuration
5. Save and Publish: saves and deploys the changes made to the server(*)

(*) There is also an option to save & full publish. This will ensure everything is deployed, as opposed to only the changes.

The following pages describe configuration options for all tabs in the host management console.

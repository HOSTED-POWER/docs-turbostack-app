## Using TurboStack Docs

This Knowledge base contains a lot of information, which can make it difficult to find the information you need instantly. Here are some tips to find the information you need in no time.

Two different searches are available: A **filter** option on the left above the table of contents, and a **search** option on the top right.

- The **filter** option allows you to search for **keywords inside the table of contents**. Try looking for words like 'setup', 'Magento', 'server', etc. Only the entries containing these keywords will be displayed.
- The **search** bar is a **global search function**. It allows you to find **any reference of the search term** across the whole knowledge base. This includes titles, table of contents items, and the contents of articles.

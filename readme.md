## Welcome

You have reached our TurboStack® documentation pages because you're interested in the full blown TurboStack® experience.
We have several scalable packages, tailored for the fastest performance. We offer staging & production packages, which can be clustered if needed. [Check out our packages here.](https://www.hosted-power.com/en/turbostack#our-packages)

If this is the first time you're trying to log in to your PoC-environment or your Production TurboStack, you've come to the right place. This is where you start. So let's get goin'!

## Account Setup

### Create a Customer Profile
First things first. You need to set up a new account in our **Customer Center**, which will give you access to your profile & environments. You can [sign-up here](https://portal.hosted-power.com/signup/).
Please fill in the required information and submit.

## Login into the Hosted Power Customer Center
You can reach the Customer Center via this link: [portal.hosted-power.com](https://portal.hosted-power.com/)
 
Our customer center enables you to:
* Manage contact information
* Add billing information
* Follow-up on your support tickets
* Purchase or transfer domain names
* Assign rights to various contacts
* Add SSH users, configure SSL certificates
* etc...

### Add Relevant Contacts
Once you’ve created an account, proceed to add all relevant contacts to your account. This step is crucial for effective communication and collaboration between Hosted Power & your team. Adding relevant contacts to your account ensures that the right people receive the right information and communication.

### Partner Integration (optional)
*If you are a direct customer, not working with Hosted Power through a partner, please continue to step 4.*

If you're a customer working through a partner, from now on referred to as "Hosted Partner" -*pun intended*-, TurboStack provides a seamless integration process. Request to link your account to the Hosted Partner using our innovative "teams" feature. The Hosted Partner can then furnish you with a unique code, enabling you to seamlessly join their account. This integration enhances coordination and ensures a unified workflow, communicating the right information to the right people.

### Set Permissions

TurboStack empowers you with granular control over account permissions. Navigate to the settings and check the appropriate permissions for each contact. Specify who can manage servers, access billing information, handle tickets, and more. This level of customization enables you to allocate resources efficiently by determining which employees can work on specific projects.

**Congratulations!** You have now successfully set up your account, laying the foundation for efficient account management and collaboration within the Hosted Power ecosystem.

## Your TurboStack® application
Once you have your customer profile set up, it's time for the real work.
Let's check out your TurboStack environment in the [TurboStack App](turbostack-app/basic_install/)

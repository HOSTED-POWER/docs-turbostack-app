# Incident Management

**Hosted Power** analyzes within the SLA response time whether the reported incident can be qualified as critical unavailability based on all the information. The analysis is done remotely (via telephone, e-mail, and or monitoring tools) by our own system engineers.

You may be requested to provide information, and possibly receive instructions to carry out simple troubleshooting or adjustments in consultation with the **Hosted Power** technicians. Hosted Power then informs the customer of the solution or proposes a workaround.

## Critical support
Critical support includes anything that prevents the correct functioning of the server and requires immediate attention. This concerns defects in the data centers infrastructure, the Hosted Power network, the hardware and the server services that result in a proven unavailability of the services provided.

## Non-critical support
All other questions related to matters that do not result in unavailability of the services provided are by definition non-critical questions. This includes (non-exhaustive list):
* Questions related to the use of the services offered
* Software support for applications provided by Hosted Power
* Configuration changes (which are not necessary to fix a critical problem)

The services that form the core of our services, such as our network, power supply, hardware cooling, etc. are proactively monitored 24/7. If a failure is indicated there, we intervene proactively & immediately. We usually see problems arise before they have real impact on your environment.

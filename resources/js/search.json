We want to implement an .htpasswd so visitors need to have a valid login, except when the request came from a whitelisted IP adress.

All requests that go through varnish will pass the header (X-Forwarded-For), but it may contain some tempered information about the visitors IP. Because of this modification, the request for immediate access will be denied and the visitor will be asked to login. To make sure this won't happen, we'll add a variable for the header that contains the whitelisted IP-adress.

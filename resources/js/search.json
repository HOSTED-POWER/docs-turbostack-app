If desired, in addition to ModSecurity, Fortinet FortiWeb Application Firewall can also be set up. This is considered case by case. A WAF goes much further than a standard firewall by analyzing the application layer (OSI layer 7) instead of stopping at Layer 3. The WAF offers, amongst other things, extra protection against SQL injection, XSS attacks, etc. According to the OWASP top 10.","The WAF contains virtual patches for a kinds of frameworks. This guarantees extra high security out of the box, because this way an (for example recently) unpatched leak can still be closed immediately before a patch has been applied to the application layer.

# phpMyAdmin

## Introduction

phpMyAdmin is a web-based tool designed to manage MySQL and MariaDB databases. It provides a user-friendly graphical interface, allowing users to perform database tasks without needing to write SQL commands manually. With phpMyAdmin, you can create, modify, and delete databases, tables, fields, and records, as well as execute SQL queries, manage user permissions, and import/export data. 

phpMyAdmin is installed by default on all Turbostack servers with MySQL enabled!

### Prerequisites

* The credentials of your SSH and database users, found in the 'credentials' tab in the [TurboStack App](https://my.turbostack.app "TurboStack App").
* A functional web browser

### Accessing phpMyAdmin

You can access the phpMyAdmin module for your application by opening your web browser and navigating to the default URL with the 'phpmyadm' path. For example: https://www.yourdomain.ext/phpmyadm.

Once there, you will encounter a password prompt. Enter your SSH user credentials (account name and password) to proceed.

This will take you to the phpMyAdmin login screen, where you need to enter your database credentials. After logging in, you can manage your databases, including tasks like creating, editing, and deleting databases, tables, and records, running SQL queries, and managing user privileges.

## Contacts

### The Primary contact
By default, the primary contact is the user who created the account in our <a href="https://portal.hosted-power.com/" target="_blank">Customer Center</a>. If you haven't done so yet, <a href="https://portal.hosted-power.com/signup/" target="_blank">you can sign up here</a>. Please fill in the required information and submit.

!!! Important 
The primary contact is always the first point of contact should a critical incident on your environment occur.
!!!

Now you can log into the **Hosted Power** Customer Center.

Our customer center enables you to:

* Manage contact information
* Add billing information
* Follow-up on your support tickets
* Purchase or transfer domain names
* Assign rights to various contacts
* Add SSH users, configure SSL certificates
* etc...

### Adding new contacts
Now it's time to add your extra contacts. Technical colleagues, billing contacts etc...

In the <a href="https://portal.hosted-power.com/" target="_blank">Customer Center</a>, navigate to Manage contacts. Here you can <a href="https://portal.hosted-power.com/profiles/add/" target="_blank">add your relevant contacts</a>. 

_May we emphasize this step is extremely important for **Hosted Power** to be able to reach the correct people in every situation, so take your time to do this thoroughly if possible. You'll thank us later!_

On the invite tab, you also have the option to invite existing contacts, e.g. an external consultant.

## Teams

### Add new teams
Navigate to <a href="https://portal.hosted-power.com/profiles/teams/" target="_blank">Teams</a> tab. Here you can <a href="https://portal.hosted-power.com/profiles/teams/" target="_blank">create your own teams</a>, e.g. Dev, Billing, Agency, etc.

### Invite external Teams

If you have a new partner requiring access to your environment, you have the possibility to <a href="https://portal.hosted-power.com/profiles/teams/invite" target="_blank">invite an existing team</a>. You can also easily remove teams from your environment.

## User/Teams Rights management 
You have the choice to either manage the rights of single users or whole teams. **Hosted Power** advises to implement the "Teams" logic, even if you have only one person in this team. It makes management a lot easier in the future.

For your colleagues to be able to log in to the <a href="https://my.turbostack.app" target="_blank">TurboStack Platform</a>, you need to give them access here.

# YAML editor (Infrastructure-as-code)

The server configuration source code is available in YAML format. This allows for the rapid creation of new, fully identical servers within seconds. 

Any modifications made in the GUI are instantly reflected in the YAML, and vice versa. Additionally, this synchronized approach gives you the flexibility to choose the method that best suits your workflow.

You can easily switch from the GUI to the YAML view by pressing the following button:

![Yaml Source Code](../img/turbostackapp/YAML/source-code.png)

You could also choose to display YAML by default via the profile settings:

![Profile Settings](../img/turbostackapp/YAML/profile-settings.png)

This video shows how you can reach the YAML for your server and make modifications:

# Standard Support

Normal service is available during office hours (and must be done through the service desk, either by [e-mail](mailto:support@hosted-power.com) and/or by telephone: 
* BE: +32 53 599 000
* NL: 085 888 4 555
* FR: 04 83 97 97 97
  
Office hours apply from Monday to Thursday between 8:45 am and 17:30pm and on Friday between 8:45 am and 16:30 pm. **Hosted Power** will always aim to help, but sometimes we need the customer or developer to be able to commit changes.

When the service desk is closed, **Hosted Power** offers a 24x7 emergency service. Failures can be reported here that lead to the critical unavailability of our services, which Hosted Power is contracted to provide or support. In case of critical unavailability of the environment, this emergency service is always free of charge for contracts. After reporting the issues over the phone, an email notification should also be submitted to support, stating the issue, unless agreed not to be necessary.

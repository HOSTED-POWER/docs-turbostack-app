MySQL is a popular open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) known for its reliability, performance, and ease of use. Itâ€™s widely used in web applications to store and manage structured data, often paired with PHP and Apache/Nginx in the LAMP/LEMP stack. MySQL supports standard SQL, ACID-compliant transactions, and features like replication, partitioning, and clustering. It's commonly used for everything from small websites to large-scale enterprise applications.

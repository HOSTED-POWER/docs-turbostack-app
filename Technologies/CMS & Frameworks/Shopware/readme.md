Shopware is a modern eCommerce platform built for performance, flexibility, and a robust developer experience. It is based on Symfony and Vue.js, and designed with scalability in mind. Whether you're managing a small storefront or a high-volume shop, Shopware is built to adapt.

This guide outlines essential details for running Shopware on our hosting platform, including file structure, permission settings, and caching options. While we provide a high-performance server environment, application-level management (plugins, themes, Shopware updates) remains your responsibility.

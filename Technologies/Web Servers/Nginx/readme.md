Nginx (pronounced "engine-x") is a high-performance web server and reverse proxy server known for its speed, stability, and low resource usage. Itâ€™s commonly used to serve static content, handle load balancing, and manage HTTP requests in high-traffic websites. Nginx can also function as a mail proxy and supports features like SSL/TLS termination, caching, and URL rewriting. Its asynchronous, event-driven architecture allows it to handle thousands of simultaneous connections efficiently.

Apache HTTP Server, commonly known as Apache, is one of the most widely used and long-standing web servers in the world. Itâ€™s known for its flexibility, extensive module system, and strong support for dynamic content through integration with languages like PHP, Python, and Perl. Apache uses a process- or thread-based architecture, which can be configured in different ways (like prefork or worker mode) to suit various performance needs. It's highly customizable and often favored for its compatibility and rich ecosystem of modules.
